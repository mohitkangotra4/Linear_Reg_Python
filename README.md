'Sales Contact 1', 'Sales Contact 2', 'Sales Contact 3', 'Sales Contact 4', 'Sales Contact 5' as our predictor variables

## Result
Using coefficients derived from multiple linear regression to see how much return we can derive from each dollar we spend. We observed clearly that for different account type different Campaigns and Different Sales Contact are effective with different extend.

## Case Explanation - Medium Facility
For Example Medium Facility shows decent results with Flyer Campiagns and each dollar spend return 4 dollars on average. Sales Contact 2 is highly effective followed by Sales Contact 1 and Sales Contact 3. Else all other strategy shows no impact can be dropped to save cost
